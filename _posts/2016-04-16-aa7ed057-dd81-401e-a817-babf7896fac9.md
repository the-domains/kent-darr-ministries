ABOUT US

Kent and Cheryl Darr

Anointed and Appointed by God to Proclaim the  "Good News,"  we count it an honor to minister in Word and Song to Church's and people of various denominations and affiliations.

In 2000, Kent Darr Ministries, Inc. was founded and granted 501c3 religious status.

Kent is an Ordained Minister with World Ministry Fellowship and serves on the  
Central Ordination Council.

We were high school sweethearts and best friends now happily married 32 years.  We reside in rural Illinois, about 40 miles north of St. Louis, Mo. where Kent continues to farm growing corn and soybeans.  He truly has an understanding of seed-time and harvest and other biblical farming examples.

We have one son, Matthew, a 2004 Rhema graduate, with BA. in Biblical Counseling and Th.M. in Theology.  
At 28, he is an awesome young man of God.

We have so much to be thankful for and so much to share with others, about how they to can have the Love, Peace and Joy of the Lord...
