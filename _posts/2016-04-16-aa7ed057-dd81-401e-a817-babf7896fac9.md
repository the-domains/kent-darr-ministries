The Word

The "IF" Factor...  
by Kent Darr

A question was brought up to me about John 14:13 "Whatsoever we ask in Jesus Name that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son".  I started studying, because this person said, I asked in Jesus name and it didn't work.  
I also reflected upon times in my life when I could have said the same thing.

I knew there had to be a good answer and the problem had to be on our end, because the Word will Never Fail.

As I studied I found conditions that a believer must do, listed just before or after  most all scriptures that have a promise.

I came up with the "If factor",  to receive the Blessings of God.

Sure salvation is a free gift and the promises of God belong to us, but lets look at the conditions to receive .

Example:  
John 14:14 "If you will ask anything in my name I will do it".

John 14:15 says "If you love me keep my commandments".

John 14:23 "If a man love me he will keep my words:".

In the 15th chapter of John we find another, "If factor".

John 15:7 " If ye abide in me and my words abide in you,  ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you.

(remember )

If you abide in Him and his Word abides in you.

John 15:10 "If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love."

Some might say in vs.10 well what are the commandments?

Jesus explains them in Matthew 22:37-40 "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.  This is the first and great commandment.  And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.  On these hang all the law and prophets."

It's LOVE...

If we obey the love command,  we'll keep the 10 commandments because they all hang on love.  
Faith also worketh by Love according to Galatians 5:6

In the Old Testament,  Deuteronomy 28 talks about the Blessing of Abraham, but we see there were conditions to receive the blessings.  
Duet. 28:1 says "And it shall come to pass If thou shall hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe and do all His commandments:".

28:2  "All these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee, If thou shall hearken unto the voice of the Lord your God".

Who 's He talking to?

US

We must hearken diligently...We must obey his commands...

We can find many examples of the " IF Factor".

In Joshua 1,  Joshua had conditions to be prosperous and have good success.  In the new testament, Paul tells us in Col. 1:23,"If you continue in faith, grounded and settled in the Word and don't be moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard:"

We can receive the things which are given to us if we will obey, believe and receive them.

A disciple is disciplined, and one who continues as a follower of Christ.  As we continue in Him like John 15:3 says, we'll be cleansed through the word.

II Timothy 2:21 says, "If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor sanctified and meet (or useful) for the masters use and prepared unto every good work."

We must spend time in the word, to prepare ourselves...purge ourselves... and follow and fulfill the conditions of the Word of God, to enable it to work on our behalf.

Read the Word in context and do exactly what it says, if you do, it will work for you.
